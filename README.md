# Interrupts-and-displays
This repo contains a single C source file CW3.cpp that turns a stock BBC micro:bit into a dual-display, real-time data logger—without busy-wait loops. Everything is written from first principles (no high-level CODAL helpers except where explicitly permitted) and respects the coursework’s automated-marking constraints.
